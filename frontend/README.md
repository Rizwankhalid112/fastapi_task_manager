This is the Task Manager frontend (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind), wired to the FastAPI backend.

## Environment

Create `.env.local` in the frontend directory to point to your API (optional):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Default is `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Run the FastAPI backend before using the app.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the landing page at `app/(public)/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
